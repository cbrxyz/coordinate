# Coordinate

Coordinate is a novel educational tool based on Discord. Coordinate is designed
to help instructors and faculty manage large computer science courses. Coordinate
automatically provides several features which are integral to the classroom experience
for students, including:

* **Authentication:** Students (and course staff) must authenticate with their student ID to gain
  access to the server. This ensures that only students enrolled in the course can access the server.
* **Office Hours:** Course staff can manage their own office hours schedule through
  the bot, which will dynamically update the public schedule when changes are made.
  Students are able to queue for virtual office hours in a fair manner. Course staff
  can easily take breaks, manage students in the queue, or mark their office hours
  as being hosted through a different platform. The office hours system also gives
  students the chance to provide feedback on the office hours experience.
* **Extensions:** Using Qualtrics, students can request extensions for course staff to
  review. Upon approval, the bot will automatically update the student's deadline in
  Canvas, or another assignment provider. The student is also notified of the outcome
  of their request.
* **Question Management:** Coordinate helps to manage questions by automatically marking
  questions as unanswered or answered, as appropriate. Furthermore, students are
  reminded of common tips for asking better questions, and the system prevents students
  from asking more than one question at a time. At the end of each week, the bot
  also provides a summary of which staff were the most active in answering questions.
